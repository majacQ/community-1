## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
Anonymous Hawk is a Decentralised application for reporters to report news without revealing their identity. Reporters will not be tracked or asked any details about them while posting news in this platform but we make sure everything is stored using Blockchain as news posted once cannot be taken down from Blockchain. All of the proofs are uploaded to IPFS and displayed in Home Page. As the reporter needs to sign smart contract during posting news this makes the news immutable as it is securely stored in Blockchain. 

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
IPFS plays important role in Anonymous Hawk as all the importnat media files are uploaded and fetched from distributed IPFS network.

## Project Status
<!--brainstorming, fundraising, under development, beta, shipped, etc-->
Project is currently under development. Reporters can post and users can read. Spam filters are yet to be added.
