## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
The Meta Manager is a fully decentralized one-stop-shop data manager for meta creators to easily manage their META and transaction data all in one place.

**Highlight features:**

* Decentralized Identifier (DID) based META/NFT metadata, which means itâ€™s truly blockchain networks agnostic.
* All data stores on IPFS nodes, which means everyone can access that data anywhere, anytime, and forever.
* The meta creators can mint an NFT or a collection of NFTs onto any blockchain networks they would like.
* The creators can use their wallet account's private/public keys to encrypt/decrypt certain sensitive data for each NFTs.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
The project utilizes IPFS to store the metadatda for digital creators but would like to explore how to plug it into Filecoin.

## Project Status
<!--brainstorming, fundraising, under development, beta, shipped, etc-->
The MVP was done during the Scaling Ethereum Hackathon and won a prize from Protocol Labs, but it's still under development to enhance the existing features and add new features. We're keen to fundraising at the same time as well.
