## Project Description
CHAINLINK + IPFS open hardware weather station. Energy and communication autonomous IoT sensor node, with weather sensors, that stores sensor data directly to IPFS and automates execution of parametric weather insurance contracts on-chain via the distributed CHAINLINK oracle system.

## Use of IPFS
IPFS is used as storage for weather data recorded by the weather station, via a custom developed library that runs directly on the weather station's microcontroller.

## Project Status
Weather station is already deployed on numerous sites, with the latest version including IPFS support.
