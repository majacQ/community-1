## Category

music, creative, culture

## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
This is a decentral web app for musicians who want to exchange and build on their musical ideas with their friends on web3.
 
It allows you, to record a track on your mobile phone or computer. You can then play back previous recordings and at the same time record another track on top. For example you could first play a riff and then add a solo in the second recording. 

You can share the project anytime with your friends and they can add further tracks (e.g. a vocal track, percussion or a synthie). Your friends can then send it back to you or distribute it further to their friends.

This way, a-jam enables you to have asynchronous jam sessions with your fellow musicians. 

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->

The web app is hosted on IPFS and it spins up a js-ipfs node that is used for file retrieval and file storage.

When a user publishes a project, the project meta data and all the audio recordings are stored on IPFS. A url for sharing is generated, which points to the decentral web app and includes the cid of the project meta data file.  

If you open the link, the project and all associated recordings are loaded from IPFS. 

## Project Status
