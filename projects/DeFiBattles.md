## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
DeFi-Battles is your one-stop-shop for minting provably unique & rare NFT characters -- Peaceful Monsters, battle other players' NFTs with your unique character powers and win rewards!

DeFi-Battles introduces a gaming aspect of the NFTs. Instead of having them as a collectible sitting in your wallet, now they can be used to battle other players' NFTs and earn rewards ✨

Much of the world is yet to be introduced to cryptocurrencies, DeFi and NFTs. Our aim with this project is to onboard them to the world of crypto with unique characters, introduce them to DeFi, deposit yields & staking in battles.

All the NFT characters on DeFi-Battles are rare and unique. All the monster characters are generated from a DNA that's uniquely generated by the Chainlink VRF. The DNA also gives them a type such as fire, water, grass etc. These characters are minted as an ERC721 token and the tokenURI is stored on IPFS. These NFTs can then be made to battle other players' NFTs by staking ETH in a winner-takes-all battle bet!

We also introduced various interesting aspects in this platform such as :

• Player VS Player battles - In which players battle other players' NFTs and earn rewards (Operational)

• Player VS Boss Battles - in this mode the boss is an NFT sponsored by advertisers and other players Battle and earn rewards based on contribution (WIP)

• The money deposited to purchase NFTs goes into an Aave pool and generates interest, hence appreciating the NFT value (WIP)

DeFi-Battles aims to be the "Top Shots" of NFTs for the Pokemon card nerds of the world. We aim to introduce them to DeFi with multipurpose NFTs and make them crypto natives. With the platform shaped as a game, we intend to gamify DeFi and make it intuitive to Gen Z and millenials.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->

DeFi Battles uses IPFS to store NFT metadata off-chain. We only save the IPFS hash on-chain. We also intend to store game data on IPFS & are exploring usescases of Filecoin in DeFi Battles.

Our DApp is also deployed on IPFS.

## Project Status
<!--brainstorming, fundraising, under development, beta, shipped, etc-->

We've an MVP ready and are currently brainstorming ideas to build it up further!
