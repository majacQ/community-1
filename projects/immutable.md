Application

## Project Description
Immutable is a web and desktop application that leverages the immutablity of blockchain and Inter Planetry File System to store critical evidences and documents pertaining to a lawsuit.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
We have used IPFS along with JavaScript in building the application. The evidences and documents uploaded by the lawyers are saved in the IPFS storage and the private keys are used to fetch the authenticity of the documents. We will also be using both FileCoin and Libp2p in some parts of our project during the Next Step Grant programme.
